features:
  - icon: 🎯
    title: Structured Five-Phase Methodology
    details: Transform complex problems into manageable phases with STARK's systematic approach. Situation analysis, Target definition, Approach design, Resource mobilization, and Knowledge integration guide you from problem understanding to verified execution.

  - icon: ⚡
    title: Autonomous Execution
    details: Run /stark:auto to handle the entire workflow end-to-end. STARK actively executes plans, manages tasks, and drives solutions to completion, saving hours of manual task coordination while you focus on strategic decisions.

  - icon: ✅
    title: Built-in Verification
    details: Every task must pass explicit acceptance criteria before completion. No more guessing whether work actually solves the problem - STARK ensures solutions meet requirements systematically.

  - icon: 🧠
    title: Self-Healing Learning System
    details: STARK gets smarter with every use. Capture feedback from executions, generate improvement proposals, and apply refinements to command prompts. The framework continuously improves itself, making your future problem-solving faster and more effective.

## Quick Start

Install STARK in Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add carlelieser/stark
/plugin install stark@carlelieser
```

Then get started immediately:

**Your First STARK Solution:**

```
/stark:auto
```

Type `/stark:auto` and describe your problem. STARK will analyze the situation, plan the solution, execute tasks, and verify completion autonomously.

**When to Use STARK:**

STARK excels at complex, multi-step problems where the solution path isn't immediately clear. It provides valuable structure for:

- Challenges with unclear or evolving requirements
- Cross-cutting changes requiring careful coordination
- Work where capturing insights improves future efficiency

For simple, well-defined tasks with straightforward solutions, STARK's systematic approach may add unnecessary overhead.

## Why STARK?

Complex problems rarely fail from lack of effort—they fail from lack of structure. Traditional development problem-solving is often ad-hoc: mental models scattered across comments, incomplete plans in tickets, context lost between sessions, no systematic verification.

STARK makes structure the default:

- **Prevents wasted effort** through upfront analysis
- **Ensures completion** with explicit verification
- **Preserves full context** for seamless resumability
- **Captures learning** to improve future problem-solving

**Result:** Faster progress on complex challenges with fewer false starts and compounding knowledge gains.
