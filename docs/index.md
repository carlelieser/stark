features:
  - icon: 🎯
    title: Structured Five-Phase Methodology
    details: Transform complex problems into manageable phases with STARK's systematic approach - Situation analysis, Target definition, Approach design, Resource mobilization, and Knowledge integration guide you from understanding to execution.

  - icon: ⚡
    title: Autonomous Execution
    details: Run /stark:auto to handle the entire workflow end-to-end. STARK actively executes your plans, manages tasks, and drives solutions to completion while you focus on high-level decisions.

  - icon: ✅
    title: Built-in Verification
    details: Every task must pass explicit acceptance criteria before completion. No more guessing whether work actually solves the problem - STARK ensures solutions meet requirements systematically.

  - icon: 🧠
    title: Self-Healing Learning System
    details: STARK gets smarter with every use. Capture feedback from executions, generate improvement proposals, and apply them to refine command prompts - creating a framework that continuously improves itself.

## Quick Start

Get up and running with STARK in minutes:

```bash
# STARK is a Claude Code plugin - no installation required
# Just start using commands in your Claude Code session
```

**Your First STARK Solution:**

```
/stark:auto
```

Type `/stark:auto` and describe your problem. STARK will analyze the situation, plan the approach, execute tasks, and verify completion autonomously.

**When to Use STARK:**

STARK is designed for complex, multi-step problems where the solution path isn't immediately obvious. It adds valuable structure for:

- Complex challenges with unclear or evolving requirements
- Cross-cutting changes requiring careful planning
- Learning-intensive work where capturing insights improves future efficiency

For simple, well-defined tasks where the solution is straightforward, STARK's systematic approach may be overhead.

## Why STARK?

Complex problems rarely fail from lack of effort—they fail from lack of structure. Traditional problem-solving in development is often ad-hoc: mental models scattered across comments, incomplete plans in tickets, context lost between sessions, and no systematic verification.

STARK makes structure the default, preventing wasted effort through upfront analysis, ensuring completion through explicit verification, preserving full context for resumability, and capturing learning to improve future problem-solving.

**Result:** Faster progress on complex challenges with fewer false starts and better knowledge retention.
