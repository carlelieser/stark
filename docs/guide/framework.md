# The STARK Framework

Complex problems rarely fail from lack of effort—they fail from lack of structure. Teams rush to solutions before understanding requirements, solve the wrong problem well, or lose valuable insights after each project. STARK provides a systematic framework that ensures you understand the problem deeply, design the right solution, and capture knowledge for future work.

## Core Principles

STARK is built on three principles:

- **Clarity Before Action:** Invest time in analysis before execution. Understanding the problem deeply before building solutions prevents rework and wasted effort. This doesn't mean analysis paralysis—it means structured inquiry that pays dividends during implementation.

- **Simplicity as Default:** Start minimal, add only what's necessary. Over-engineering wastes time solving problems you don't have yet. Begin with the simplest approach that meets your acceptance criteria, then evolve based on actual needs.

- **Learning Over Perfection:** Ship, learn, iterate. Capturing insights and improving continuously beats trying to get everything perfect on the first attempt. Document what you learn to make every problem-solving session better than the last.

## The Five Phases

STARK guides you through five sequential phases, each building on the previous one:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Situation:** Understand the problem deeply before attempting solutions. Analyzes current state, constraints, root causes, and impact to ensure you're solving the right problem. Most failed projects solve the wrong problem well—this phase prevents wasted effort by investing in understanding before action.

**Target:** Define what success looks like with measurable criteria. Establishes clear acceptance criteria and minimum viable outcomes so you know when you're done. Without clear targets, projects drift endlessly or ship work that doesn't actually solve the need.

**Approach:** Design the solution path by evaluating options and selecting the best approach. Creates an executable task breakdown that guides implementation systematically. Choosing the right approach early prevents costly mid-project pivots and technical debt.

**Resources:** Identify and mobilize what's needed for execution. Maps required tools, knowledge, dependencies, and constraints before starting work. Discovering missing resources mid-execution causes delays—this phase surfaces blockers while you can still plan around them.

**Knowledge:** Capture learnings to improve future problem-solving. Documents insights, decisions, and outcomes to build organizational memory and continuously improve the framework itself. Without capturing knowledge, teams repeat mistakes and lose hard-won insights when people leave or forget.

## From Phases to Practice

These phases aren't abstract theory—they're embedded in STARK's command workflow. When you run `/stark:new`, you're working through Situation and Target analysis. `/stark:plan` designs your Approach and identifies Resources. `/stark:run` executes tasks while `/stark:verify` ensures quality. Finally, `/stark:learn` captures Knowledge for continuous improvement.
