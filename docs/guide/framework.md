# The STARK Framework

Complex problems rarely fail from lack of effort—they fail from lack of structure. STARK provides a systematic framework that ensures you understand the problem deeply, design the right solution, and capture knowledge for future work.

## Core Principles

STARK is built on three axioms:

- **Clarity Before Action:** Invest time in analysis before execution
- **Simplicity as Default:** Start minimal, add only what's necessary
- **Learning Over Perfection:** Ship, learn, iterate

## The Five Phases

```

**Situation:** Understand the problem deeply before attempting solutions. Analyzes current state, constraints, root causes, and impact to ensure you're solving the right problem.

**Target:** Define what success looks like with measurable criteria. Establishes clear acceptance criteria and minimum viable outcomes so you know when you're done.

**Approach:** Design the solution path by evaluating options and selecting the best approach. Creates an executable task breakdown that guides implementation systematically.

**Resources:** Identify and mobilize what's needed for execution. Maps required tools, knowledge, dependencies, and constraints before starting work.

**Knowledge:** Capture learnings to improve future problem-solving. Documents insights, decisions, and outcomes to build organizational memory and continuously improve the framework itself.
