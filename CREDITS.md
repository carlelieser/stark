## Acknowledgments

- **Anthropic** - For building Claude Code and the plugin ecosystem that makes STARK possible
- **The Claude Code Community** - For feedback, testing, and contributions
- **Systems Thinking Pioneers** - Peter Senge, Donella Meadows, and others whose work influenced STARK's methodology

## Foundational Concepts

STARK draws inspiration from:

- **OODA Loop** (John Boyd) - Military decision-making framework inspiring iterative approach
- **Design Thinking** - Problem-solving focused on user needs and iteration
- **Getting Things Done** (David Allen) - Task management emphasizing clear next actions

## Special Thanks

This framework emerged from real-world frustration with ad-hoc problem-solving in software development. Every command, prompt, and workflow pattern represents lessons learned from failed approaches and hard-won insights.

STARK is built on the belief that structure shouldn't constrain creativity - it should free you to think clearly by removing the cognitive load of managing process.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to making that vision real.
