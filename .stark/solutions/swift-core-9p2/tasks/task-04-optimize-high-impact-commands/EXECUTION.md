# Execution Log

**Task:** Optimize High-Impact Commands
**Started:** 2025-12-15T23:50:00
**Status:** In Progress

## Execution Strategy

Following the sequential optimization approach from Deliberation 2:
1. Optimize /stark:think first (medium complexity)
2. Then /stark:plan (low risk, quick win)
3. Finally /stark:auto (highest complexity, enhanced safety)

Quality rubrics: Zero tolerance for functional/analytical degradation, flexible on verbosity.
Safety: In-place editing with git checkpoints after each successful optimization.

### Step 0: Pre-Execution Setup
**Status:** In Progress
**Output:**
Creating git checkpoint and reading prerequisite materials before optimization begins.
