## Steps Executed

### Step 1: Validate Real-World Evidence of Working Integration
**Status:** Complete
**Approach:** Use swift-core-9p2's own execution as primary validation

**Evidence Collection:**
The swift-core-9p2 solution has been running with optimized commands throughout. File analysis confirms:
- Solution structure: Complete 5-phase solution.md (490 lines)
- Task count: 8 task folders with complete REPORT.md files
- Deliberation count: 11 deliberation files across tasks
- Execution logs: 6 complete EXECUTION.md files
- Verification reports: 3 complete VERIFICATION.md files

**Workflow Integration Evidence:**
- `/stark:new` → Solution folder created successfully
- `/stark:plan` → Complete 490-line solution.md with all STARK phases
- `/stark:task` → 8 tasks created with comprehensive REPORT.md files
- `/stark:think` → 11 deliberations showing iterative analysis
- `/stark:ready` → Readiness checks performed (evidenced by execution progression)
- `/stark:run` → 6 tasks executed with complete execution logs
- `/stark:verify` → 3 verification reports with PASS results
- Command chaining: Sequential workflow from new → plan → task → think → run → verify working correctly

**Data Flow Validation:**
- Solution.md → Task REPORT.md (problem context flows correctly)
- REPORT.md → DELIBERATION.md (task requirements inform deliberation)
- DELIBERATION.md → EXECUTION.md (deliberation guides execution)
- EXECUTION.md → VERIFICATION.md (execution results feed verification)
- No file structure errors, no missing required sections, no data format issues

**Result:** PASS - Full workflow integration confirmed through real solution execution
