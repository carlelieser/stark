# Execution Log

**Task:** Methodology Overview
**Started:** 2025-12-15T16:25:00Z
**Status:** Complete

## Steps Executed

### Step 1: Extract Core Content from SYSTEM.md
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Successfully extracted:
- ASCII diagram (lines 82-112 from SYSTEM.md)
- Three core axioms (lines 25-32 from SYSTEM.md)
- Phase descriptions from comprehensive methodology sections

### Step 2: Draft Phase Descriptions
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Created five concise phase descriptions (2 sentences each):
- **Situation:** Focus on deep problem understanding and root cause analysis
- **Target:** Emphasis on measurable success criteria and acceptance criteria
- **Approach:** Highlights solution design and executable task breakdown
- **Resources:** Centers on identifying and mobilizing required assets
- **Knowledge:** Emphasizes learning capture and continuous improvement

Each description follows the pattern: [What it does] + [Key benefit/output]

### Step 3: Create or Adapt ASCII Diagram
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Copied SYSTEM.md diagram exactly (lines 82-112). Decision rationale:
- Already optimized for clarity
- No duplication concern (diagrams are visual reference)
- Maintains consistency between README and SYSTEM.md
- Questions in diagram serve as quick reference

### Step 4: Write "Why STARK" Rationale
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Opening paragraph (38 words):
"Complex problems rarely fail from lack of effort—they fail from lack of structure. STARK provides a systematic framework that ensures you understand the problem deeply, design the right solution, and capture knowledge for future work."

Connects to reader's prior experience and explains the framework's purpose.

### Step 5: Assemble and Polish Section
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Assembled complete section with structure:
1. Opening rationale (38 words)
2. Core Principles subsection with three axioms as bulleted list (27 words)
3. The Five Phases subsection with ASCII diagram
4. Five phase descriptions (105 words total)
5. Learn More subsection with link to SYSTEM.md (24 words)

Total prose: 194 words (well under 300-word limit)

Section header: "## The STARK Framework" (matches SYSTEM.md, professional tone)

### Step 6: Validation
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
✅ Word count: 194 words (106 words under limit)
✅ Five phases explained with 2 sentences each
✅ ASCII diagram included and properly formatted
✅ Link to SYSTEM.md in closing paragraph
✅ Three core principles (axioms) presented in bulleted list
✅ Explains "why STARK" in opening paragraph (structure prevents failure)
✅ No duplication of SYSTEM.md content (original descriptions, diagram is reference)
✅ Proper markdown formatting verified
✅ Natural flow from Quick Start to methodology explanation

## Changes Made

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| /Users/devplex/Documents/Projects/Development/stark/README.md | Modified | Replaced "Core Concepts" section with "The STARK Framework" methodology overview |

**Specific Changes:**
- Removed TODO placeholders for phases 1-5 (Analyze, Plan, Execute, Verify, Reflect)
- Removed TODO placeholders for workflow diagram and core principles
- Added opening rationale paragraph explaining why structure matters
- Added "Core Principles" subsection with three axioms
- Added "The Five Phases" subsection with ASCII diagram from SYSTEM.md
- Added five phase descriptions (Situation, Target, Approach, Resources, Knowledge)
- Added "Learn More" subsection with comprehensive link to SYSTEM.md
- Total section length: ~50 lines of markdown (compact and scannable)

## Issues Encountered

**None.** Execution proceeded smoothly according to plan.

**Key decisions made:**
1. Used "The STARK Framework" as H2 header instead of "Methodology Overview" for consistency with SYSTEM.md
2. Copied SYSTEM.md diagram exactly rather than simplifying (maintains visual consistency)
3. Structured axioms as bulleted list for scannability
4. Placed SYSTEM.md link in closing paragraph rather than early reference (rewards reading overview first)
5. Phase descriptions focus on "what it does" + "key benefit" rather than methodology details

## Completion

**Finished:** 2025-12-15T16:26:00Z
**Status:** Complete
**Notes:**

Successfully created methodology overview section that meets all acceptance criteria. The section:
- Provides high-level framework understanding without duplicating SYSTEM.md
- Maintains professional tone consistent with rest of README
- Uses accessible language (no jargon or academic terminology)
- Fits naturally between Quick Start and Usage Examples
- Encourages deeper exploration via SYSTEM.md link
- Stays well under word count limit (194 vs 300 words)

The section serves as a conceptual bridge between "using STARK" (previous sections) and "understanding STARK deeply" (SYSTEM.md), giving readers enough context to grasp the framework's philosophy while keeping content concise and actionable.
