# Deliberation 1

**Task:** Introduction and Value Proposition
**Created:** 2025-12-15T15:45:00

## Review of Prior Thinking

This is the first deliberation for Task 2. The REPORT.md provides a comprehensive execution plan with 6 steps to create the introduction section. Key aspects from the plan:

- **60-Second Test:** Must answer: What is STARK? What problem? Relevant to me? What next?
- **Target Word Count:** 300-400 words total
- **Structure:** Opening hook (100 words) + Expansion paragraphs (200-300 words)
- **Tone:** Professional but accessible, active voice, concrete benefits
- **Critical Success Factor:** Value proposition in first 100 words

The task builds on Task 1 (completed) which created the README skeleton with placeholder sections. Current skeleton shows:
- "## Introduction" section exists with 3 subsections
- Placeholders: Opening hook, What is STARK?, Why STARK Exists, Who Should Use STARK
- Professional tagline already in place: "A systematic problem-solving framework for Claude Code..."

---

## New Insights

### 1. Alignment with Existing Skeleton Structure

The README skeleton has **pre-defined subsections** that differ slightly from the REPORT.md's original plan:
- Skeleton has: Opening hook → What is STARK? → Why STARK Exists → Who Should Use STARK
- REPORT.md planned: Opening (100w) → Expansion paragraphs (methodology, differentiators, use cases)

**Insight:** The skeleton's structure is actually **better** for scannability. It uses explicit H3 headers to guide readers, rather than unmarked paragraphs. This should be preserved.

**Adaptation Required:** Instead of writing flowing paragraphs, write content that fits the existing subsection structure:
1. Opening hook (before "What is STARK?" header) - 1-2 sentences
2. "What is STARK?" subsection - 2-3 paragraphs (150-200 words)
3. "Why STARK Exists" subsection - 1-2 paragraphs (100-150 words)
4. "Who Should Use STARK" subsection - 1 paragraph with list (50-100 words)

### 2. The Tagline Already Delivers Partial Value

Current tagline: "A systematic problem-solving framework for Claude Code that transforms complex challenges into structured, trackable solutions."

This **already** communicates:
- What it is (systematic framework)
- Platform (Claude Code)
- Core benefit (complex → structured)
- Key feature (trackable)

**Implication:** The opening hook doesn't need to repeat this. Instead, it should **expand** or **humanize** the tagline, focusing on the *why* and the user's pain point.

### 3. STARK as Acronym vs. Full Name

The skeleton uses "STARK - Structured Thinking And Reasoning Kit" as the H1 title. However:
- SYSTEM.md reveals STARK stands for: **Situation, Target, Approach, Resources, Knowledge**
- This creates potential confusion

**Critical Question:** Should the introduction clarify the acronym immediately, or let it unfold naturally through the "Core Concepts" section?

**Recommendation:** Mention the five phases in "What is STARK?" but don't force the acronym explanation. The title's "Structured Thinking And Reasoning Kit" is more accessible as a brand name. The S-T-A-R-K phase mapping can be revealed in Core Concepts.

### 4. The Real Value Proposition

After reviewing SYSTEM.md and the solution analysis, STARK's differentiators are:
1. **Systematic clarity before action** (prevents wasted effort on wrong solution)
2. **Built-in verification** (ensures tasks actually complete successfully)
3. **Self-healing learning system** (improves itself over time)
4. **Autonomous execution mode** (/stark:auto handles entire workflow)
5. **Context preservation** (solutions are fully documented and resumable)

The introduction should lead with #1 or #4 (most compelling), mention #3 (unique differentiator), and reference the rest.

### 5. Avoiding the "Framework Fatigue" Problem

Developers are exposed to countless frameworks. The introduction must differentiate STARK from:
- Generic problem-solving advice (STARK is executable, integrated with Claude Code)
- Project management tools (STARK is developer-native, code-centric)
- Note-taking systems (STARK has active commands, not passive documentation)

**Strategy:** Lead with the automation/integration angle. "This isn't a methodology you manually follow—it's built into your Claude Code workflow."

### 6. The Skeleton's Audience Definition Placeholder

The skeleton includes "Who Should Use STARK" as a dedicated subsection. This is smart because:
- Helps readers self-select quickly
- Prevents mismatched expectations
- Can use bulleted list for scannability

**Content for this section:**
- Primary: Developers with complex, multi-step problems
- Use cases: Unclear requirements, cross-cutting changes, new systems
- Anti-use-cases: Trivial tasks, well-defined simple problems (don't need STARK overhead)

---

## Questions Resolved

**Q: Should the introduction focus on the methodology (5 phases) or the tooling (slash commands)?**
A: **Both, but in sequence.** Start with the problem and value (tooling angle: "automated problem-solving"), then briefly introduce methodology (5 phases), then mention the commands enable it. This flows from user pain → solution → mechanism.

**Q: How technical should the language be?**
A: **Accessible to intermediate developers.** Assume familiarity with:
- Claude Code (given)
- Software development concepts (refactoring, architecture, testing)
- Problem-solving terminology (requirements, acceptance criteria)

Don't assume knowledge of specific methodologies or academic frameworks.

**Q: Should we mention the learning system in the introduction?**
A: **Yes, briefly.** It's a unique differentiator. Mention in "What is STARK?" as one of the key features, but don't deep-dive (that's what the dedicated Learning System section is for). One sentence: "STARK includes a self-healing learning system that captures execution feedback to improve its own prompts over time."

**Q: What tone should the opening hook have?**
A: **Problem-aware, slightly provocative, but professional.** Example approach:
- ❌ Too casual: "Ever feel lost when tackling big coding problems?"
- ❌ Too bland: "STARK is a problem-solving framework."
- ✅ Right tone: "Complex problems rarely fail from lack of effort—they fail from lack of structure."

**Q: Should the introduction include an example?**
A: **No, not here.** The skeleton has a dedicated "Usage Examples" section. The introduction should focus on concepts and value. Examples would make it too long and distract from the core message.

**Q: How do we handle the tension between "framework" (sounds heavy) and "automated" (sounds easy)?**
A: **Frame it as "guided automation."** STARK provides the structure, Claude Code does the execution. You're not manually following a checklist—you're invoking commands that apply the methodology for you.

## Open Questions

**Q: Should we add a visual comparison table (Before STARK vs. With STARK)?**
Current status: Not in skeleton structure, not in REPORT.md plan.
Recommendation: Skip for introduction. Could be powerful but risks making intro too long. Consider for future enhancement or separate "Why STARK?" page.

**Q: How explicitly should we address the "when NOT to use STARK" angle?**
Current plan: Implicitly covered in "Who Should Use STARK" (by listing ideal use cases).
Recommendation: Include one line in that subsection: "STARK adds valuable structure for complex problems but may be overhead for simple, well-defined tasks."

**Q: Should we link to external resources (problem-solving theory, related frameworks)?**
Recommendation: No. Keep introduction self-contained. The "Resources" section can include external references.

## Recommendation

**READY**

### Rationale

The task is ready for execution with clear adaptations to work with the existing skeleton:

**Why Ready:**
1. ✅ Skeleton structure provides clear content targets (4 subsections)
2. ✅ Value proposition is well-understood (clarity, automation, learning)
3. ✅ Tone and style guidelines are clear (professional but accessible)
4. ✅ Word count targets are reasonable (300-400 total, ~50-200 per subsection)
5. ✅ Source material available (SYSTEM.md for methodology, solution.md for context)
6. ✅ Differentiators identified (self-healing, autonomous, verification)
7. ✅ All acceptance criteria are measurable
8. ✅ No blocking dependencies (Task 1 complete, README skeleton exists)

**Key Adaptations from Original Plan:**
- Work with existing subsection structure (3 H3 headers) rather than unmarked paragraphs
- Opening hook is now 1-2 sentences (not 100 words) due to tagline already existing
- "What is STARK?" becomes the main content block (~150-200 words)
- Add explicit "Who Should Use STARK" content (not in original plan but needed per skeleton)

**Content Strategy:**
1. **Opening Hook (before first H3):** Problem-focused statement connecting to user pain
2. **What is STARK?:** Define framework, mention 5 phases, highlight automation and learning system
3. **Why STARK Exists:** Explain the gap (ad-hoc problem solving → systematic approach)
4. **Who Should Use STARK:** List ideal use cases, mention when NOT to use (anti-pattern)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **If too long:** Cut examples (save for dedicated section), tighten language
- **If too technical:** Replace jargon with plain language, add brief definitions
- **If value unclear:** Lead with most concrete benefit (autonomous execution)
- **If tone off:** Review against "professional but accessible" standard, check active voice

**Execution Readiness Checklist:**
- [x] README.md skeleton exists with Introduction section
- [x] SYSTEM.md available for methodology details
- [x] Differentiators identified and prioritized
- [x] Subsection structure understood
- [x] Word count targets defined per subsection
- [x] Acceptance criteria can be validated
- [x] No open questions blocking content creation

**Proceed to /stark:ready for formal verification, then /stark:run for execution.**
