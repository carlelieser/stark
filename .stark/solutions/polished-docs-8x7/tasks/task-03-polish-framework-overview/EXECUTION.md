# Execution Log

**Task:** Polish Framework Overview
**Started:** 2025-12-15 20:30
**Status:** Complete

---

## Steps Executed

### Step 1: Enhance Opening Context
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Enhanced the opening paragraph to establish why structured problem-solving matters by adding concrete failure patterns: "Teams rush to solutions before understanding requirements, solve the wrong problem well, or lose valuable insights after each project."

This provides concrete context while maintaining the strong opening sentence about structure vs. effort.

---

### Step 2: Expand Core Principles with Concrete Meaning
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
- Changed "three axioms" to "three principles" for more accessible terminology
- Expanded each principle from 1 sentence to 3 sentences:
  - **Clarity Before Action:** Added explanation of preventing rework, distinguished from analysis paralysis
  - **Simplicity as Default:** Added context about over-engineering risks, emphasized starting minimal
  - **Learning Over Perfection:** Added explanation of continuous improvement value

Each principle now explains what it means in practice with concrete, actionable language.

---

### Step 3: Add Diagram Introduction
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Added single sentence before ASCII diagram: "STARK guides you through five sequential phases, each building on the previous one:"

This sets up what readers are about to see and emphasizes the sequential, cumulative nature of the phases.

---

### Step 4: Enhance Phase Descriptions
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Added "why it matters" sentence to each of the five phase descriptions:
- **Situation:** "Most failed projects solve the wrong problem well—this phase prevents wasted effort by investing in understanding before action."
- **Target:** "Without clear targets, projects drift endlessly or ship work that doesn't actually solve the need."
- **Approach:** "Choosing the right approach early prevents costly mid-project pivots and technical debt."
- **Resources:** "Discovering missing resources mid-execution causes delays—this phase surfaces blockers while you can still plan around them."
- **Knowledge:** "Without capturing knowledge, teams repeat mistakes and lose hard-won insights when people leave or forget."

Each addition explains the failure mode that phase prevents, making the value tangible.

---

### Step 5: Add "From Phases to Practice" Section
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Created new section after phase descriptions that bridges conceptual understanding to practical command usage. Explains how phases map to commands:
- `/stark:new` → Situation and Target analysis
- `/stark:plan` → Approach and Resources
- `/stark:run` and `/stark:verify` → Execution and quality
- `/stark:learn` → Knowledge capture

Includes navigation to Workflow Guide and examples for deeper exploration.

---

### Step 6: Enhance Learn More Section
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Restructured "Learn More" section to provide graduated learning paths:
- Examples (for learning by doing)
- Workflow Guide (for practical patterns)
- Complete Methodology (for deep theory)

Added guidance on which path to choose based on learning style. Maintains bullet formatting for scannability.

---

### Step 7: Review for Voice and Flow
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Reviewed entire page for:
- Terminology consistency (changed "axioms" to "principles" throughout)
- Voice consistency (professional but accessible, concrete examples)
- Flow and transitions (smooth progression from opening → principles → phases → practice → next steps)
- Language accessibility (avoided academic tone, used concrete examples)

All sections flow naturally and maintain consistent voice with getting-started.md and index.md.

---

### Step 8: Validate Against Acceptance Criteria
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Validated all acceptance criteria:
- ✓ Core principles are clearly explained with concrete meaning
- ✓ Five-phase diagram is effective and well-explained
- ✓ Each phase description is clear and actionable
- ✓ Explanations balance conceptual understanding with practical application
- ✓ Language is accessible without being oversimplified
- ✓ Cross-reference to methodology is clear and helpful
- ✓ Content demonstrates why structure matters

All criteria met successfully.

## Content Additions Summary

**Total additions:** ~22 sentences to original ~25 sentence page (now ~47 sentences)

**Enhancement breakdown:**
- Opening context: +1 sentence (failure patterns)
- Core principles: +6 sentences (2 per principle explaining practical meaning)
- Diagram introduction: +1 sentence (sequential flow explanation)
- Phase descriptions: +5 sentences (1 per phase on failure mode prevented)
- From Phases to Practice: +4 sentences (new section bridging to commands)
- Learn More: +5 sentences net (restructured with guidance)

**Page remains scannable through:**
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Bullet formatting in principles and Learn More
- Visual ASCII diagram
- Parallel structure in phase descriptions

## Issues Encountered

None. Execution proceeded smoothly according to plan. All enhancements were surgical additions that preserved existing strong content while adding depth and connections.

---

## Quality Checks Performed

1. **Terminology Consistency:** Verified "principles" used throughout (replaced "axioms")
2. **Voice Consistency:** Checked tone matches getting-started.md (professional but accessible)
3. **Flow:** Tested transitions between sections for natural progression
4. **Cross-references:** Verified all internal links point to correct pages
5. **Balance:** Confirmed page maintains overview nature (conceptual foundation) without duplicating workflow.md or methodology.md content
6. **Scannability:** Ensured additions maintain scannable structure through headings and bullets

## Completion

**Finished:** 2025-12-15 20:45
**Status:** Complete
**Notes:**

Task executed successfully following the 8-step plan. All acceptance criteria met. The framework overview page now:

1. Establishes WHY structure matters through concrete failure patterns
2. Explains the three core principles with actionable, practical meaning
3. Provides clear context for the five-phase diagram
4. Demonstrates the value of each phase by explaining failure modes prevented
5. Bridges conceptual understanding to practical command usage
6. Guides users to next learning steps based on their goals

The page maintains its role as conceptual foundation between getting-started.md (action-focused) and workflow.md/methodology.md (detailed application/theory). Content is professional, accessible, and purposeful—every addition serves the goal of helping users understand why STARK's structure delivers value.

**Word count:** Original ~350 words → Enhanced ~650 words (appropriate for framework overview)
**Reading time:** ~3 minutes (scannable structure maintains accessibility)
**Learning outcome:** Users can now articulate why each phase matters and how phases connect to practice
