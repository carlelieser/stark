# Execution Log

**Task:** Polish Getting Started Guide
**Started:** 2025-12-15 20:30
**Status:** In Progress

## Steps Executed

### Step 1: Read and Understand Current Content
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Read current getting-started.md (47 lines). Identified structure:
- Title/description frontmatter
- Brief intro (1 line)
- Prerequisites (2 bullets)
- Your First STARK Solution (autonomous workflow)
- Want More Control? (manual workflow)
- What Happens Behind the Scenes (explanation)
- Next Steps (4 bullets)

Current strengths preserved:
- Excellent conciseness
- Clear code examples
- Both autonomous and manual workflows presented
- Clean navigation

Ready to proceed with surgical enhancements.

### Step 2: Enhance Introduction and Prerequisites
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Added welcoming intro paragraph:
- Sets "under 5 minutes" expectation explicitly
- Builds confidence with "No methodology knowledge required"
- Creates smooth entry point

Expanded prerequisites:
- Enhanced Claude Code line: "STARK is built-in, no additional setup needed"
- Strengthened no-knowledge line with framework context
- Added transition: "Let's get started with the simplest possible approach"

Added 4 sentences total while maintaining conciseness.

### Step 3: Refine "Your First STARK Solution" Section
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Enhanced autonomous workflow section:
- Kept punchy "One command. That's all you need." opening
- Improved explanation of what STARK does: "Watch as it works through each phase automatically, building a complete solution with full documentation of every decision made"
- Emphasizes both automation AND learning value
- Maintains simplicity while adding clarity about the experience

### Step 4: Improve "Want More Control?" Section
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Major improvements to manual workflow section:
- Added context intro: "STARK handled everything automatically above. Here's what happened internally - and how you can control each step when you need to:"
- Enhanced all inline comments to be more descriptive:
  - "/stark:setup" → "initializes STARK system"
  - "/stark:new" → "Creates solution analysis"
  - "/stark:plan" → "Develop detailed execution plan"
  - "/stark:run" → "Execute specific tasks one at a time"
  - "/stark:complete" → "Finalize solution and capture learnings"
- Added closing paragraph explaining value: "This manual approach gives you control over timing, lets you review plans before execution, and allows you to tackle complex problems that benefit from deliberate phase-by-phase work."

This frames manual mode as transparency + option, not equally recommended alternative.

### Step 5: Expand "What Happens Behind the Scenes"
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Significantly enhanced this section while maintaining conciseness:
- Added transition: "Whether you use autonomous or manual mode, STARK follows the same systematic approach"
- Expanded from 3 sentences to structured explanation with bullet list
- Added specific artifacts created:
  - Problem analysis and solution plan
  - Task execution reports with detailed steps
  - Deliberation notes capturing key decisions
  - Verification results confirming completion
- Enhanced value proposition: "creates a learning artifact you can review and improve upon"
- Added practical benefit: "Need to pause? Come back anytime - STARK knows exactly where you left off"

Concrete examples make the value immediately clear.

### Step 6: Enhance Next Steps Section
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Transformed from bullet list to tailored learning paths:
- Added transition: "You now know how to run STARK. Here's how to go deeper:"
- Created 4 distinct paths based on user intent:
  1. "Ready to solve your own problems?" - Action-oriented users
  2. "Want to see more examples first?" - Learning-oriented users
  3. "Curious how STARK's methodology works?" - Theory-oriented users
  4. "Need the complete command reference?" - Reference-seeking users
- Each path includes:
  - Question-based heading that matches user mindset
  - Specific guidance on what they'll get
  - Clear link to relevant documentation
- Maintains all original links but adds compelling context
- Provides clear learning progression

### Step 7: Improve Overall Flow and Transitions
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Added strategic transitions throughout:
- After prerequisites: "Let's get started with the simplest possible approach."
- Before manual workflow: "STARK handled everything automatically above. Here's what happened internally..."
- Before behind the scenes: "Whether you use autonomous or manual mode, STARK follows the same systematic approach:"
- Before next steps: "You now know how to run STARK. Here's how to go deeper:"

These create narrative coherence and guide users smoothly through the page.

### Step 8: Validate and Polish
**Status:** Complete
**Output:**
Final validation completed:

**Code Examples Verified:**
- `/stark:auto` syntax: Correct
- Manual workflow commands: All accurate
- Command comments: Enhanced and verified

**Internal Links Verified:**
- `/guide/examples` → exists at docs/guide/examples.md ✓
- `/guide/framework` → exists at docs/guide/framework.md ✓
- `/reference/commands` → exists at docs/reference/commands.md ✓

**Terminology Consistency:**
- "Five-phase approach" aligns with framework.md
- Solution ID format consistent
- Command names match actual slash commands

**Conciseness Check:**
- Original: 47 lines
- Enhanced: 68 lines
- Net addition: 21 lines (45% increase)
- Content ratio: Preserved ~60% as-is, enhanced ~40%
- "Under 5 minutes" promise: MAINTAINED - still scannable in 3 minutes, actionable in under 5

**Quality Metrics:**
- Voice: Friendly expert, professional but encouraging ✓
- Accessibility: Beginner-friendly without being condescending ✓
- Action-orientation: Clear calls to action throughout ✓
- Value-add: Every addition builds confidence or clarity ✓
