# Task: Polish Workflow Guide

**Solution:** polished-docs-8x7
**Task ID:** task-04-polish-workflow-guide
**Status:** Executed

---

## Description

Enhance the workflow guide (guide/workflow.md) to clearly demonstrate how to use STARK in practice with session flows, best practices, and practical guidance. This guide bridges the gap between understanding STARK's framework and actually applying it to real work.

---

## Analysis

### Current State Assessment

The workflow.md file currently provides:
- A comprehensive STARK session flow diagram showing the progression from problem identification through completion
- Decision points explaining when to use manual vs autonomous mode, when to run /stark:think, and when to use the learning system
- Eight best practices covering analysis, acceptance criteria, task breakdown, context preservation, deliberation, verification, learning capture, and solution review
- Four common patterns: iterative refinement, batch processing, exploration mode, and quality gate enforcement

**Strengths:**
- The session flow diagram is well-structured and comprehensive
- Decision points are practical and well-explained
- Best practices are actionable and include specific guidance
- Common patterns provide concrete examples of real workflows
- Content is already quite strong with good structure

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- Some explanations could be more concise without losing value
- A few transitions between sections could be smoother
- Examples in the patterns section could benefit from more context
- The decision points section could use slightly clearer formatting
- Best practices could be more scannable with better formatting
- Cross-references to other documentation pages could be added
- The introduction is minimal - could set better context

### Content Quality Evaluation

**Clarity:** 8/10 - Content is clear but some sections are dense and could benefit from better formatting for scannability.

**Consistency:** 7/10 - Generally consistent but terminology usage varies slightly (e.g., "task completion" vs "task completed successfully").

**Engagement:** 7/10 - Practical and helpful but could be more engaging with better formatting and slightly more energetic language.

**Examples:** 8/10 - Pattern examples are good but could use more contextual setup to show why each pattern matters.

### Target Improvements

1. **Introduction Enhancement** - Add a brief, compelling introduction explaining why workflow guidance matters and what this page provides
2. **Section Formatting** - Improve formatting in decision points and best practices for better scannability
3. **Cross-References** - Add helpful links to related documentation (framework.md, examples.md, commands.md)
4. **Pattern Context** - Enhance pattern examples with better scenario setup and outcome descriptions
5. **Consistency Pass** - Standardize terminology and phrasing across all sections
6. **Transitions** - Improve flow between sections with better connecting language
7. **Practical Tips** - Add a few more concrete tips or warnings based on common user experiences

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workflow patterns are clearly explained
- [ ] Session flow examples are practical and realistic
- [ ] Best practices are actionable and well-justified
- [ ] Guidance on when to use manual vs autonomous modes is clear
- [ ] Common pitfalls and how to avoid them are addressed
- [ ] Content complements framework.md without redundancy
- [ ] Examples demonstrate real workflow decisions

## Execution Plan

### Step 1: Enhance Introduction
Add a compelling introduction that:
- Explains the purpose of this workflow guide
- Sets context for how it complements the framework overview
- Previews what users will learn (session flow, decision points, best practices, patterns)
- Makes clear this bridges theory and practice

### Step 2: Improve Session Flow Section
Polish the session flow diagram and explanation:
- Review the ASCII diagram for clarity
- Ensure the "Expected Timeline" paragraph is well-placed and helpful
- Add a sentence or two explaining how to use this flow diagram
- Consider adding a cross-reference to examples.md for concrete examples

### Step 3: Refine Decision Points Section
Enhance each decision point subsection:
- Improve formatting for better scannability (consider using clearer formatting for lists)
- Ensure consistent structure across all three decision point subsections
- Tighten language where verbose
- Add cross-references where helpful (e.g., link to /stark:auto in examples.md)

### Step 4: Polish Best Practices
Refine the eight best practices:
- Consider numbering or clearer formatting for each practice
- Ensure each practice has a clear structure: principle → explanation → specific guidance
- Tighten wordy explanations
- Add cross-references where relevant
- Ensure consistent tone and voice

### Step 5: Enhance Common Patterns
Improve each of the four patterns:
- Add more contextual setup for each scenario
- Ensure command examples are formatted consistently
- Strengthen the "Key insight" for each pattern
- Consider adding expected outcomes or results
- Make patterns more visually distinct from each other

### Step 6: Add Cross-References
Strategically add helpful cross-references:
- Link to framework.md when mentioning STARK's methodology
- Link to examples.md for concrete usage examples
- Link to commands.md for command details
- Link to methodology.md for deeper theoretical content
- Ensure links are helpful and not excessive

### Step 7: Final Consistency and Flow Review
Conduct final polish pass:
- Verify consistent terminology throughout
- Check that voice and tone are consistent
- Ensure smooth transitions between sections
- Verify all formatting is consistent
- Read through entirely to ensure natural flow

### Step 8: Verify Against Acceptance Criteria
Final verification that all acceptance criteria are met:
- Patterns are clear and practical
- Session flow is realistic and helpful
- Best practices are actionable
- Decision guidance is clear
- Pitfalls are addressed
- No redundancy with framework.md
- Examples show real decisions

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Over-editing makes content less natural | Low | Medium | Preserve conversational tone, only edit where clarity improves |
| Breaking the good existing structure | Very Low | High | Make targeted improvements rather than restructuring |
| Adding too many cross-references | Low | Low | Only add links that genuinely help user navigate related content |
| Making content too formal | Low | Medium | Maintain balance between professional and accessible |
| Losing practical focus | Very Low | High | Ensure all changes preserve or enhance practical applicability |
| Creating inconsistency with other pages | Low | Medium | Reference framework.md and examples.md during editing |

## Dependencies

**Required Before Execution:**
- Access to /Users/devplex/Documents/Projects/Development/stark/docs/guide/workflow.md
- Read access to related documentation for cross-referencing context:
  - docs/guide/framework.md (for consistency with framework overview)
  - docs/guide/examples.md (for cross-reference opportunities)
  - docs/reference/commands.md (for command reference accuracy)

**No Blockers:**
- All files are accessible
- No external dependencies
- No prerequisites from other tasks
- Ready to execute

**Context from Previous Tasks:**
- Task 1 (Homepage polish) - Established tone and voice standards
- Task 2 (Getting Started polish) - Established user journey approach
- Task 3 (Framework polish) - Established how methodology is presented

This task should maintain consistency with the improvements made in previous tasks.
