## Changes Made

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| /package.json | Created | Node.js project configuration with VitePress as devDependency and npm scripts |
| /package-lock.json | Created | Dependency lock file (auto-generated by npm) |
| /node_modules/ | Created | Dependencies directory (170 packages, ignored by git) |
| /docs/index.md | Created | Homepage placeholder content |
| /docs/.vitepress/config.js | Created | VitePress configuration with site metadata and theme settings |
| /.gitignore | Modified | Added VitePress build artifacts and dependencies to exclusions |

## Issues Encountered

**No significant issues encountered.**

Minor notes:
- npm audit reported 3 moderate severity vulnerabilities in dependencies. These are in VitePress dependencies and can be addressed with `npm audit fix` if needed, but do not block Task 1 completion.
- macOS does not have `timeout` command by default, used alternative approach to test dev server (background process with sleep/kill).

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] VitePress installed as dev dependency (npm install -D vitepress)
- [x] docs/ directory created with proper structure
- [x] package.json scripts configured (dev, build, preview)
- [x] .vitepress/config.js configured with site metadata
- [x] .gitignore updated to exclude node_modules and build artifacts
- [x] Local dev server runs successfully (npm run docs:dev)
- [x] Production build completes successfully (npm run docs:build)
- [x] Build output directory contains site files
- [x] Preview server serves built site (npm run docs:preview)

**Finished:** 2025-12-15T17:38:00
**Status:** Complete
**Notes:**

All acceptance criteria met successfully. VitePress is fully initialized and operational:
- Development server runs without errors at http://localhost:5173/stark/
