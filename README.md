# STARK - Structured Thinking And Reasoning Kit

> A systematic problem-solving framework for Claude Code that transforms complex challenges into structured, trackable solutions.

[TODO: Add badges - version, license, status]

---

## Introduction

Complex problems rarely fail from lack of effort—they fail from lack of structure. STARK brings systematic clarity to problem-solving within Claude Code, transforming ambiguous challenges into tracked, verifiable solutions.

### What is STARK?

STARK is a five-phase problem-solving framework built directly into your Claude Code workflow. Rather than manually following a methodology, you invoke commands that apply structured thinking for you. Each phase—Situation analysis, Target definition, Approach design, Resource mobilization, and Knowledge integration—guides you from problem understanding through execution to learning capture.

The framework integrates autonomous execution (/stark:auto handles the entire workflow), built-in verification (every task must pass acceptance criteria), and a self-healing learning system that improves its own prompts based on execution feedback. Solutions are fully documented and resumable, with every decision, deliberation, and outcome preserved in structured markdown files.

STARK doesn't just help you think through problems—it actively executes your plans, verifies completion, and gets smarter with every use.

### Why STARK Exists

Traditional problem-solving in development is often ad-hoc: mental models scattered across comments, incomplete plans in tickets, context lost between sessions, and no systematic verification that work actually solves the problem. This works for simple tasks but breaks down when complexity increases.

STARK addresses this by making structure the default. It prevents wasted effort on wrong solutions through upfront analysis, ensures tasks actually complete through explicit verification, preserves full context for resumability, and captures learning to improve future problem-solving. The result is faster progress on complex challenges with fewer false starts and better knowledge retention.

### Who Should Use STARK

STARK is designed for developers working with Claude Code who face:

- **Complex, multi-step problems** where the solution path isn't immediately obvious
- **Unclear or evolving requirements** that need systematic analysis before implementation
- **Cross-cutting changes** requiring careful planning and coordination
- **Learning-intensive work** where capturing insights improves future efficiency

STARK adds valuable structure for complex problems but may be overhead for simple, well-defined tasks where the solution is straightforward. If you already know exactly what to do and how to do it, you probably don't need STARK's systematic approach.
